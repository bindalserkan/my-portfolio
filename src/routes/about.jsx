          After spending nearly a decade working as an Electronics Engineer in
          the Air Force, I have decided to pursue something new.

          I was seeking a fresh beginning and despite the negative impact of
          pandemic, it turned out to be beneficial for me, much like it did for
          many others worldwide. It gave me the opportunity to reset and explore
          new horizons.

          Actually, one of my friends played a pivotal role in guiding me
          towards a path in software development. Sometimes, it just takes that
          one spark from a friend to set you on a whole new adventure. Thanks to
          him.🫶

          Frontend development is an exiting journey and I&apos;ve been glad to dive
          into this world. I&apos;m open both to the comforts of remote work and the
          thrill of on-site opportunities. But hey, while coding, I&apos;ve also got
          my little feline friend, my trusty sidekick, to keep me company on
          this adventure. And let&apos;s not forget the beautiful mother of nature,
          offering her wisdom and inspiration. So, here&apos;s to a career full of
          pixels, purrs, and the wonders of the great outdoors!💻😻🍂
